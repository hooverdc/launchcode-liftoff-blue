Project description: 
A movie journaling applications that allows users to create Individual User Profiles where they can add movies that they have watched to personal lists. Along with this, users will be able to write reviews about movies that they have seen, as well as 'like' movies. Users will also be able to receive movie recommendations based on the films that are on their 'watched' lists.
