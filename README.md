## **Project description:**
A movie journaling application that allows users to create individual user profiles where they can add movies and tv shows that they have watched to personal lists. Users will also be able to write reviews, 'like' or 'dislike' what they have watched, find streaming information, and receive movie recommendations based on the films that are on their 'watched' lists.
